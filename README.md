Modern Personal Finance Dashboard with AI Integration

### 🧠 Overview
Flowee Finance is a modern, dark-mode financial management app built with React.  
It focuses on clarity, performance, and aesthetic excellence — combining

their transactions, visualize data, and (soon) receive AI-driven  
financial insights.
